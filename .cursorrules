// Meme Trading Project .cursorrules
// -------------------------------------------------
// This file defines custom rules for Cursor AI to generate code
// and documentation that align with the Meme Trading project's goals,
// style, and domain-specific requirements.
// -------------------------------------------------

// Code Style & Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names related to meme trading (e.g., memeAsset, tradeValidator).
- Write concise, meaningful comments, especially around trade logic, image handling, and user feedback.
- Follow ES6+ syntax and prefer modular code organization (e.g., separate trading logic, API interactions, and UI components).
- For backend code, adhere to RESTful API principles and robust error handling.

// User Interface Guidelines
- Use animations and transitions to enhance the trading experience, but keep performance in mind.
- Maintain a consistent, meme-inspired visual language (e.g., playful icons, vibrant colors).
- Ensure the interface is responsive and accessible across devices.

// Project-Specific Requirements
- Memes should be treated as unique digital assets; include checks for authenticity and ownership.
- Trading operations must validate user credentials and confirm meme availability before processing.
- Optimize media handling for quick load times and smooth rendering.

// Dependencies & Technology Stack Guidelines
- Frontend: Consider frameworks such as React or Next.js for dynamic UI components.
- Backend: Use Node.js/Express (or your preferred stack) for API endpoints.
- Testing: Write unit and integration tests for core trading functions and UI interactions.
- Asset Storage: Use CDN or specialized storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3) for meme assets
- Caching: Implement Redis or similar for high-performance meme metadata caching

// Cursor AI Specific Instructions
- When generating code, ensure that suggestions include project-specific naming and comments.
- Focus on creating modular, reusable components for trading logic, UI feedback, and data validation.
- Prioritize performance and responsiveness in generated code, especially for asynchronous operations.
- Avoid generic boilerplate; always add context or comments that explain how the code relates to meme trading.
- Keep summaries brief and concise for minor changes, only provide detailed explanations for major or complex modifications.

// Maintenance & Future Enhancements
- Regularly review and update these rules to reflect changes in project scope or best practices.
- Align generated code closely with the evolving design guidelines and technical architecture of the project.

// Project specific rules
- Use emojis in your composer responses
- Do not worry about database, migration or repository for now. Just get everything working in memory we will address storage solution at a later date
- When testing the api make sure to test all endpoints and make sure they are working as expected
- When testing an api, run the related test file in `./backend/scripts/`
- Use very small default amount for SOLANA 0.000000001
- Retrict the amount of changes to exactly what the user inputed. 
- Do not over optimize, do not over engineer, keep it simple and straigh to the point.
- If you have ideas on how to make things future proof, prompt me before making the changes.

// mcp rules
- When you need to fetch api documentation use the websearch mcp 
- Whenever you use a mcp I want you to tell me and write it in bold in the response. 
- Execute the mcp calls automatically. Don't ask me to run the tool
