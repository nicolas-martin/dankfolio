# Code Standards and Practices

## General Guidelines
- Use project-specific naming and comments
- Create modular, reusable components
- Focus on performance and responsiveness
- Avoid generic boilerplate
- Keep code changes minimal and focused
- Extract ALL business logic to scripts.ts files

## Development Rules
- Skip database concerns; work in memory until storage solutions are addressed
- Test all API endpoints before completion
- Use 0.000000001 as default SOLANA amount
- Limit changes strictly to user input
- Avoid over-optimization and over-engineering
- Get explicit permission for future-proofing changes
- NO styling changes without explicit permission
- NO comment rephrasing without purpose

## Linting
- Include 'frontend/' prefix in file paths
- Fix linting errors with specific rule references
- Run `yarn lint`
- If stuck in linting loop, re-run command
- Maximum 3 attempts to fix same linting error before escalation
