// User Interface Guidelines
- Provide immediate visual feedback on user actions (e.g., drag-and-drop for meme trading).
- Use animations and transitions to enhance the trading experience, but keep performance in mind.
- Maintain a consistent, meme-inspired visual language (e.g., playful icons, vibrant colors).
- Ensure the interface is responsive and accessible across devices.
