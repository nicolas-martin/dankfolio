# Project Structure

## Directory Organization
- Root directory: `./dankfolio`
- Backend: `./dankfolio/backend`
- Frontend: `./dankfolio/frontend`

## Component Structure
Every component and screen must follow this structure:
```
ComponentName/
├── index.tsx                    # Main component file (JSX & minimal logic)
├── componentname_scripts.ts     # Business logic and utilities
├── componentname_styles.ts      # Styled components or styles
├── componentname_types.ts       # TypeScript interfaces and types
└── ComponentName.test.tsx       # Test file (if applicable)
```

## Make Commands
- `make run`: Terminates existing backend and runs a new one
- `make mobile`: Terminates existing instance, starts new one, runs 2 linters

## Working Directory Rules
- Backend operations must be run from `./dankfolio/backend`
- Frontend operations must be run from `./dankfolio/frontend`
- Make commands must be run from root `./dankfolio`

## File Naming Convention
- All utility files must be prefixed with the component name in lowercase
- Test files should be named after the component with .test.tsx extension
- Keep index.tsx as the main component file
- Use descriptive, lowercase names for all files except index.tsx and test files
