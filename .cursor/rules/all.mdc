### Structure
## Project
- The only make file is located at the root of the project `./dankfolio`. Make sure your `pwd` is `./dankfolio`
- The common make operation in the make file is `make run` which terminates any existing backend and runs a new one`
- When modifying components or screen, you do not need to run `make mobile`. That is only needed for big strutural / dependency changes.

## Backend
- Whe performing a backend operation or command, make sure your `pwd` is `./dankfolio/backend`

## Frontend
- Whe performing a frontend operation or command, make sure your `pwd` is `./dankfolio/frontend`

Each `component` or `screen` MUST follow this directory structure:
```
ComponentName/
├── index.tsx        # Main component file (JSX & minimal logic)
├── scripts.ts       # Business logic and utilities
├── styles.ts        # Styled components or styles
└── types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces and types
```

### Component Rules
- **index.tsx should ONLY contain:**
  - React component definition
  - JSX structure
  - Basic hooks (useState, useEffect)
  - Props handling
  - Import statements

- **scripts.ts should contain:**
  - Business logic
  - Helper functions (use descriptive verbs)
  - Constants (UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE)
  - Calculations & transformations
  - Animation logic
  - Event handlers
  - Complex hooks

- **styles.ts:**
  - Use styled-components or StyleSheet.create()
  - Keep ALL styling logic here
  - Use theme variables
  - No inline styles in components

- **types.ts:**
  - All interfaces and types
  - Clear, descriptive names
  - Export all definitions

### Code Migration Process
1. Always start with types
2. Move logic to scripts.ts
3. Keep components clean and presentational
4. No business logic in components

## Cursor AI Specific Instructions

- Include project-specific naming and comments in generated code.
- Create modular, reusable components for trading logic, UI feedback, and data validation.
- Focus on performance and responsiveness, especially for asynchronous operations.
- Avoid generic boilerplate; add context or comments relating the code to meme trading.
- Keep summaries brief for minor changes and detailed only for major modifications.
- ALWAYS follow the component organization structure above.
- Extract ALL business logic to scripts.ts files.

  
- Use emojis in your composer responses.
- Skip database, migration, or repository concerns; work in memory until storage solutions are addressed.
- Test all API endpoints and confirm they function as expected.
- Use a very small default amount for SOLANA: 0.000000001.
- Limit changes strictly to the user's input.
- Avoid over optimizing or over engineering; keep it simple and straight to the point.
- Ask before applying ideas for future proofing.
- Avoid making unecessary style change or comment changes.
- NEVER make styling changes on your own. You always need explicit permission.
- Avoid making changes that are only rephrasing of a comment.

## Linting `yarn lint`
- We need to include the frontend/ prefix in our file paths.
- Whenever you make an edit, include the rule that you're fixing.
- If you get stuck in a loop, try running the command again
