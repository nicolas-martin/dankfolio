      "description": "A local dog owner is pleading for the public’s help after her Yorkshire Terrier was stolen from her car in Rowland Heights.\r\n\r\nAs of Sunday night, both the suspect and the 11-year-old Yorkie named Lemon have not been found.\r\n\r\nThe owner, Yue Zuo, said that the last time she saw Lemon was on the night of April 19, before her car was broken into at a parking lot near Plaza at Puente Hills.\r\n\r\nZuo said she had briefly stepped away around 9 p.m., leaving Lemon in her Tesla with Dog Mode activated, which, according to the Tesla website, is a feature that allows owners to keep the climate control system running.\r\n\r\nWhen Zuo came back to her car, she found her passenger-side window had been smashed into and that her 7-pound pup was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nA friend of Zuo’s reached out to KTLA on Sunday afternoon, saying that it appeared the suspect was stealing from a few other vehicles before approaching the Tesla.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the suspect purportedly approached the Tesla three times before breaking in, grabbing Lemon and driving away in their own vehicle.\r\n\r\nNeither Zuo nor the friend mentioned if anything else was stolen from the Tesla, but they both said that they were able to obtain surveillance videos from different nearby businesses.\r\n\r\nZuo said she filed a police report and shared photos of the suspect’s car with law enforcement.\r\n\r\nHowever, she said police told her that the suspect’s license plates were fake.",
